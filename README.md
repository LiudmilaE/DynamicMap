# Ironhack | Project 2 | Dynamic Map Nelene

## Introduction
This is a repository for the one-week Project during Web Development Bootcamp in Ironhack in Paris - creating a full-stack application in pairs.

Application is deployed on Heroku.
[Nelene](https://nelene.herokuapp.com)

## Used technologies
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Passport.js
- Google maps
- Heroku 
- ES6
- Bulma

## Personal Opinion
The most difficult part was to implement authentication on the server side. 
But I think we managed to create decent application for one week project and without prior experience in backend development

## Team Members
This was a group project that I completed with [Elodie Wanang](https://github.com/Lalo8)
